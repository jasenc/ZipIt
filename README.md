# Confounded Interest

#### User Manual
	
This program requires minimal input from the user. All you need to do is input your credit card interest rate, your initial balance and the amount you plan to charge and pay off each month. 

#### System Manual 

This program is fairly crude and unattractive. 	 I had to use an if statement for every month of the year. There are many improvements that could take place in this program, such as not needing 12 different if statements for displaying the correct months or making the program able to handle charges and payments that differ between themselves and also across different months. The program is output on the c console and also in an output file that is hard written within the program. Although the c console is not that pretty, the output file is tab-delimited so it can easily be copied and paste into excel for a more friendly appearance. After the basics are printed to their respective places and variables taken care of the while loop is initiated. To keep track of how many months there are there is an int that increases by one for every time the loop is processed. Then depending on how many times the loop has been processed the corresponding month will be print with the data. The program uses three subprograms. One is a simple introduction for the end user. Another retrieves the data for the end user and the last simply prints everything to the console of your choice.

#### Test Log

Believe it or not I encountered no strenuous problems in the making of this program. It took me a long time to get the loops to work correctly and everything to work the way it should but there was no one problem that I was completely stumped on. Things came to me eventually, luckily.
